# Recall_Cost
Wesnoth addon - mod to reduce cost of recalling level zero units

Has it ever bothered you that recalling level zero units costs 20 gold?

Well, this addon modifies the recall cost for level zero units.  The default is set to 10 gold, but it can be adjusted with a slider.

But wait, there's more! What's the use of the discount without a few extra level zero units to recall?  You can start campaigns or multiplayer scenarios with a handful of random level zero units in the recall list.  Campaigns can be played with these units only at start, or with a few more after every scenario.

And finally, introducing the star of the show: the Trainee Mage.  This unit is as hapless as you would expect, but with a twist.  The Trainee has a destiny; it will level up into some random, unexpected level one mage-like unit.
