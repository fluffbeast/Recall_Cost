# Recall_Cost
Wesnoth addon - mod to reduce cost of recalling level zero units

This addon modifies the recall cost for level zero units.  The default is set to recruit cost + 1, but other options are available.

You can start campaigns or multiplayer scenarios with a handful of random level zero units in the recall list.  Campaigns can be played with these units at start, or with more after every scenario.

There is an optional new unit: the Trainee Mage.  This weak level 0 unit has a destiny; it will level up into some random, unexpected level one mage-like unit.  You do not get to choose or view what it will level into.

This addon is designed for wesnoth 1.16+, and contains units from the Default L0 Era.
