description="Modify the recall cost for level zero units.

The default recall cost for level zero units is set to recruit cost + 1, but other options are available.

You may start campaigns or multiplayer scenarios with a handful of random level zero units in the recall list.  Campaigns can be played with these units at start, or with more after every scenario.

There is an optional new unit: the Trainee Mage.  This weak level 0 unit has a destiny; it will level up into some random, unexpected level one mage-like unit.  You do not get to choose what it will level into.

There is an option to include units from the War of Legends addon for more level 0 units and Trainee Mage advancements.

This mod uses units from the Default L0 Era."
