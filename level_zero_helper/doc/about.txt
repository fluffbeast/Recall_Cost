Level Zero Helper

This mod has several optional features:

 * Changes the recall cost of level zero units.  The new default is recruit cost + 1.

 * Adds a few random level zero units to the recall list.  This works for both campaigns and multiplayer.  Campaigns can be played with an initial recall list, or with new level zero units after each scenario.

 * New level zero unit - Trainee Mage.  This weak level 0 unit has a destiny; it will level up into some random, unexpected level one mage-like unit.  You do not get to choose what it will level into.

 * In addition to core units, this also uses units from Default L0 era.
