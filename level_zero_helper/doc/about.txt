Level Zero Helper

This mod has several optional features:

 * Changes the recall cost of level zero units.  The new default is recruit cost + 1.

 * Adds a few random level zero units to the recall list.  This works for both campaigns and multiplayer.  Campaigns can be played with just an initial recall list, or with new level zero units after each scenario.

 * New level zero unit - Trainee Mage.  This unit is as hapless as you would expect, but with a twist. Each Trainee has a destiny; it will level up into some random, unexpected level one mage-like unit.

 * In addition to core units, also use units from Default L0 era or War of Legends era.
